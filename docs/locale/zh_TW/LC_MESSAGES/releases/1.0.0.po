"Channels 1.0.0 brings together a number of design changes, including some "
"breaking changes, into our first fully stable release, and also brings the "
"databinding code out of alpha phase. It was released on 2017/01/08."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.0.0.rst:8
msgid ""
"The result is a faster, easier to use, and safer Channels, including one "
"major change that will fix almost all problems with sessions and "
"connect/receive ordering in a way that needs no persistent storage."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.0.0.rst:12

"It was unfortunately not possible to make all of the changes backwards "
"compatible, though most code should not be too affected and the fixes are "
"generally quite easy."

msgid ""
"Rather than be immediately accepted, WebSockets now pause during the "
"handshake while they send over a message on ``websocket.connect``, and your "

"You can now reject WebSockets before they even finish connecting, giving "

"ever get into a connected state and send messages."

#: ../../releases/1.0.0.rst:42
msgid ""
"Combined with Consumer Atomicity (below), it means there is no longer any "
"need for the old \"slight ordering\" mode, as the connect consumer must run "
"to completion and accept the socket before any messages can be received and "
"forwarded onto ``websocket.receive``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.0.0.rst:47

"Any ``send`` message sent to the WebSocket will implicitly accept the "

"Consumers will now buffer messages you try to send until the consumer "
"completes and then send them once it exits and the outbound part of any "
"decorators have been run (even if an exception is raised)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.0.0.rst:59
msgid ""
"This makes the flow of messages much easier to reason about - consumers can "
"now be reasoned about as atomic blocks that run and then send messages, "
"meaning that if you send a message to start another consumer you're "
"guaranteed that the sending consumer has finished running by the time it's "
"acted upon."

msgid "Databinding Group/Action Overhaul"
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.0.0.rst:76
msgid ""
"Previously, databinding subclasses had to implement ``group_names(instance, "
"action)`` to return what groups to send an instance's change to of the type "
"``action``. This had flaws, most notably when what was actually just a "
"modification to the instance in question changed its permission status so "
"more clients could see it; to those clients, it should instead have been "
"\"created\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.0.0.rst:83
msgid ""
"Now, Channels just calls ``group_names(instance)``, and you should return "
"what groups can see the instance at the current point in time given the "
"instance you were passed. Channels will actually call the method before and "
"after changes, comparing the groups you gave, and sending out create, update"
" or delete messages to clients appropriately."

"Existing databinding code will need to be adapted; see the \"Backwards "
"Incompatible Changes\" section for more."

msgid "Demultiplexer Overhaul"
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.0.0.rst:96
msgid ""
"Demuliplexers have changed to remove the behaviour where they re-sent "
"messages onto new channels without special headers, and instead now "
"correctly split out incoming messages into sub-messages that still look like"
" ``websocket.receive`` messages, and directly dispatch these to the relevant"
" consumer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../releases/1.0.0.rst:101
msgid ""
"They also now forward all ``websocket.connect`` and ``websocket.disconnect``"
" messages to all of their sub-consumers, so it's much easier to compose "
"things together from code that also works outside the context of "
"multiplexing."
