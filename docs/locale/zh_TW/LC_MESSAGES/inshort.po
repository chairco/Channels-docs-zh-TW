"Channels extends Django to add :ref:`a new layer <what-are-channels>` that "

msgid "How?"

#: ../../inshort.rst:20
msgid "It separates Django into two process types:"
msgstr "這將Django分成2種運行類型:"

#: ../../inshort.rst:22
msgid "One that handles HTTP and WebSockets"

"One that runs views, websocket handlers and background tasks (*consumers*)"

msgid ""
"They communicate via a protocol called :doc:`ASGI <asgi>`, which is similar "
"to WSGI but runs over a network and allows for more protocol types."
msgstr ""

#: ../../inshort.rst:28
msgid ""
"Channels does not introduce asyncio, gevent, or any other async code to your"
" Django code; all of your business logic runs synchronously in a worker "
"process or thread."

msgid "I have to change how I run Django?"
msgstr "我必須改變我使用Django的方法？"

#: ../../inshort.rst:36
msgid ""
"No, all the new stuff is entirely optional. If you want it, however, you'll "
"change from running Django under a WSGI server, to running:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../inshort.rst:39
msgid "An ASGI server, probably `Daphne <http://github.com/django/daphne/>`_"
msgstr ""

#: ../../inshort.rst:40
msgid "Django worker servers, using ``manage.py runworker``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../inshort.rst:41
msgid "Something to route ASGI requests over, like Redis."
msgstr ""

#: ../../inshort.rst:43
msgid ""
"Even when you're running on Channels, it routes all HTTP requests to the "
"Django view system by default, so it works like before."

msgstr "這可以縮放嗎？"

#: ../../inshort.rst:64
msgid ""
"Yes, you can run any number of *protocol servers* (ones that serve HTTP and "
"WebSockets) and *worker servers* (ones that run your Django code) to fit "
"your use case."
msgstr ""

#: ../../inshort.rst:68
msgid ""
"The ASGI spec allows a number of different *channel layers* to be plugged in"
" between these two components, with different performance characteristics, "
"and it's designed to allow both easy sharding as well as the ability to run "
"separate clusters with their own protocol and worker servers."

#: ../../inshort.rst:75
msgid "Why doesn't it use my favourite message queue?"
msgstr "為什麼它不使用我的喜好排序訊息？"

#: ../../inshort.rst:77
msgid ""
"Channels is deliberately designed to prefer low latency (goal is a few "
"milliseconds) and high throughput over guaranteed delivery, which doesn't "
"match some message queue designs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../inshort.rst:81
msgid ""
"Some features, like :ref:`guaranteed ordering of messages <enforcing-"
"ordering>`, are opt-in as they incur a performance hit, but make it more "
"message queue like."

#: ../../inshort.rst:86
msgid "Do I need to worry about making all my code async-friendly?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../inshort.rst:88
msgid ""
"No, all your code runs synchronously without any sockets or event loops to "
"block. You can use async code within a Django view or channel consumer if "
"you like - for example, to fetch lots of URLs in parallel - but it doesn't "
"affect the overall deployed site."
