"It changes the way Django runs to be \"event oriented\" - rather than just "
"responding to requests, instead Django responds to a wide array of events "

"view is called."

"Instead of having Django run in the traditional request-response mode, "

"In fact, this is how Channels works. The interface servers transform "

"However, the crucial part is that you can run code (and so send on channels)"

"The second kind of channel, however, is used for replies. Notably, these "

"第二種通道用途是用於回覆。值得注意是他們只有做一件事就是監聽 -介面服務。每一個回應的 channel 是各自獨立的名稱且當其 client "

msgid ""
"This is not a massive difference - they both still behave according to the "
"core definition of a *channel* - but presents some problems when we're "
"looking to scale things up. We can happily randomly load-balance normal "
"channels across clusters of channel servers and workers - after all, any "
"worker can process the message - but response channels would have to have "
"their messages sent to the channel server they're listening on."

"For this reason, Channels treats these as two different *channel types*, and"
" denotes a *reply channel* by having the channel name contain the character "
