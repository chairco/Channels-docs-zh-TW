msgid "When you configure channel routing, the object assigned to a channel should be a callable that takes exactly one positional argument, here called ``message``, which is a :ref:`message object <ref-message>`. A consumer is any callable that fits this definition."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference.rst:14
msgid "Consumers are not expected to return anything, and if they do, it will be ignored. They may raise ``channels.exceptions.ConsumeLater`` to re-insert their current message at the back of the channel it was on, but be aware you can only do this so many time (10 by default) until the message is dropped to avoid deadlocking."

msgid "``channel_layer``: A :ref:`ChannelLayer <ref-channellayer>` object, representing the underlying channel layer this was received on.
