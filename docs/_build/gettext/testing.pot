msgid "When you want to write unit tests for your new Channels consumers, you'll realize that you can't use the standard Django test client to submit fake HTTP requests - instead, you'll need to submit fake Messages to your consumers, and inspect what Messages they send themselves."
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:9
msgid "We provide a ``TestCase`` subclass that sets all of this up for you, however, so you can easily write tests and check what your consumers are sending."
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:14
msgid "ChannelTestCase"
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:16
msgid "If your tests inherit from the ``channels.test.ChannelTestCase`` base class, whenever you run tests your channel layer will be swapped out for a captive in-memory layer, meaning you don't need an external server running to run tests."
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:20
msgid "Moreover, you can inject messages onto this layer and inspect ones sent to it to help test your consumers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:23
msgid "To inject a message onto the layer, simply call ``Channel.send()`` inside any test method on a ``ChannelTestCase`` subclass, like so::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:34
msgid "To receive a message from the layer, you can use ``self.get_next_message(channel)``, which handles receiving the message and converting it into a Message object for you (if you want, you can call ``receive_many`` on the underlying channel layer, but you'll get back a raw dict and channel name, which is not what consumers want)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:39
msgid "You can use this both to get Messages to send to consumers as their primary argument, as well as to get Messages from channels that consumers are supposed to send on to verify that they did."
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:43
msgid "You can even pass ``require=True`` to ``get_next_message`` to make the test fail if there is no message on the channel (by default, it will return you ``None`` instead)."

msgid "Generic Consumers"
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:68
msgid "You can use ``ChannelTestCase`` to test generic consumers as well. Just pass the message object from ``get_next_message`` to the constructor of the class. To test replies to a specific channel, use the ``reply_channel`` property on the ``Message`` object. For example::"

msgid "Groups"
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:93
msgid "You can test Groups in the same way as Channels inside a ``ChannelTestCase``; the entire channel layer is flushed each time a test is run, so it's safe to do group adds and sends during a test. For example::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:112
msgid "Clients"
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:114
msgid "For more complicated test suites you can use the ``Client`` abstraction that provides an easy way to test the full life cycle of messages with a couple of methods: ``send`` to sending message with given content to the given channel, ``consume`` to run appointed consumer for the next message, ``receive`` to getting replies for client. Very often you may need to ``send`` and than call a consumer one by one, for this purpose use ``send_and_consume`` method::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:131
msgid "You can use ``HttpClient`` for websocket related consumers. It automatically serializes JSON content, manage cookies and headers, give easy access to the session and add ability to authorize your requests. For example::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:184
msgid "Instead of ``HttpClient.login`` method with credentials at arguments you may call ``HttpClient.force_login`` (like at django client) with the user object."
msgstr ""

msgid "``receive`` method by default trying to deserialize json text content of a message, so if you need to pass decoding use ``receive(json=False)``, like in the example."

msgid "Applying routes"
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:194
msgid "When you need to testing you consumers without routes in settings or you want to testing your consumers in more isolate and atomic way, it will be simpler with ``apply_routes`` contextmanager and decorator for your ``ChannelTestCase``. It takes list of routes that you want to use and overwrite existing routes::"

msgid "Test Data binding with ``HttpClient``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:214
msgid "As you know data binding in channels works in outbound and inbound ways, so that ways tests in different ways and ``HttpClient`` and ``apply_routes`` will help to do this. When you testing outbound consumers you need just import your ``Binding`` subclass with specified ``group_names``. At test you can  join to one of them, make some changes with target model and check received message. Lets test ``IntegerValueBinding`` from :doc:`data binding <binding>` with creating::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:257
msgid "There is another situation with inbound binding. It is used with :ref:`multiplexing`, So we apply two routes: websocket route for demultiplexer and route with internal consumer for binding itself, connect to websocket entrypoint and test different actions. For example::"

#: ../../testing.rst:290
msgid "If you want to test code that uses multiple channel layers, specify the alias of the layers you want to mock as the ``test_channel_aliases`` attribute on the ``ChannelTestCase`` subclass; by default, only the ``default`` layer is mocked."
msgstr ""

#: ../../testing.rst:295
msgid "You can pass an ``alias`` argument to ``get_next_message``, ``Client`` and ``Channel`` to use a different layer too."
